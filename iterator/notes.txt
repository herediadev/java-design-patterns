Use to
    traverse a container
    Does not expose underlying structure
    decouple algorithms
    sequential

Design
    interface based
    factory method based
    independent, but fail fast
    enumerators are fail safe

Diagram
    iterator
    concreteIterator

the idea is to hide the index and the way we get a value from the collection
hide the algorithm
simplify the client
