It is used when the type of the object to create is determined by a prototypical instance
which is clone to get a new instance

apply as a refactoring pattern

Concepts
    Avoids costly creation
    Avoids subclassing
    Typically does not use the "new" keyword
    Often utilizes an interface
    Usually implemented with a Registry

Design
    Clone/Clonable
    Avoids keyword "new"
    Although a copy, each instance unique
    Costly construction not handled by client
    Can still utilize parameters for construction
    Shallow VS Deep Copy

Guarantee unique instance
Can help with performance issue
Do not always jump to a Factory
