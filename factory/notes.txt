type: creational

Concepts
    does not expose instantiation logic
    defer to subclasses
    common interface
    specified by architecture, implemented by user
    parameter driven
    solves complex creation
    enforce a contract
    Opposite of a singleton

Design
    Factory
    ConcreteFactory
    Factory is responsible for lifecycle
    common interface
    concrete classes
    parameterized create method

it must be designed upfront
