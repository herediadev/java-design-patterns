It is used for handling the construction that may contain a lot of parameter
and we want to make the object immutable once it is done constructing it

type: creational

Concepts
    Handle complex constructor
    Large number of parameters
    Immutability once the the object is built

Design
    Builder
    Concrete Builder
    Flexibility over telescoping constructor
    static inner class
    calls appropriate constructor
    negates the needs for exposed stters
